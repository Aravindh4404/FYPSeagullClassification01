We evaluate ResNet-50, VGG-16, Inception-v3, EfficientNet-B3, MobileNetv3, ViT, DeiT, and ConvNeXt on the CUB- 200-2011 dataset. Each model was trained using the PyTorch library on a high-performance server, with early stopping employed to prevent overfitting. Our results indicate that DeiT achieves the highest accuracy (85.6%) and F1 score (85.6%), while MobileNetv3 shows the best computational efficiency. These findings offer valuable insights into selecting appropriate models for fine-grained classification tasks based on specific application requirements.}

Utilizing a substantial dataset comprising images of ten bird species which was selected carefully to challenge the model to classify species of extreme similarities. To achieve this, we were keen to collect the data with subtle visual dissimilarities and of different positions taken for these birds. The research explores the potential of deep learning techniques to differentiate species based on subtle inter-species variations. This task is particularly demanding due to the minimal yet critical differences between these closely related species. Our research leveraged a unique deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify birds with minimal visual differences. This innovative approach marks a significant step forward in machine learning for biological classification, with implications for biodiversity and ecological conservation. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our deep learning model in accurately classifying bird species, showcasing the potential of advanced techniques in complex Classification tasks. This research enhances the use of computational methods in biodiversity and ecological conservation. Additionally, it underscores the importance of birds as indicators of environmental changes, such as climate shifts, aiding in early detection of potential ecological issues.}

ABSTRACT = {Classifying birds accurately is essential for ecological monitoring. In recent years, bird image classification has become an emerging method for bird recognition. However, the bird image classification task needs to face the challenges of high intraclass variance and low inter-class variance among birds, as well as low model efficiency. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained bird classification method based on attention and decoupled knowledge distillation. First of all, we propose an attention-guided data augmentation method. Specifically, the method obtains images of the object’s key part regions through attention. It enables the model to learn and distinguish fine features. At the same time, based on the localization–recognition method, the bird category is predicted using the object image with finer features, which reduces the influence of background noise. In addition, we propose a model compression method of decoupled knowledge distillation. We distill the target and nontarget class knowledge separately to eliminate the influence of the target class prediction results on the transfer of the nontarget class knowledge. This approach achieves efficient model compression. With 67% fewer parameters and only 1.2 G of computation, the model proposed in this paper still has a 87.6% success rate, while improving the model inference speed.},

abstract="Bird species classification has received more and more attention in the field of computer vision, for its promising applications in biology and environmental studies. Recognizing bird species are difficult due to the challenges of discriminative region localization and fine-grained feature learning. In this paper, we have introduced a Transfer learning based method with multistage training. We have used both Pre-Trained Mask-RCNN and a ensemble model consists of Inception Nets (InceptionV3 net {\&} InceptionResnetV2) to get both the localization and species of the bird from the images. we have tested our model in an Indian bird dataset consist of variable size, high-resolution images are taken from camera in various environments (like day, noon, evening etc.) with different perspectives and occlusions. Our final model achieves an F1 score of 0.5567 or 55.67{\%} on that dataset.",
