The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) framework provides a robust approach for texture analysis in biological image classification. Our implementation extends the conventional LBP methodology with novel abstract pattern analysis and comprehensive comparative metrics, specifically optimized for differentiating \textit{Slaty-backed Gull} and \textit{Glaucous-winged Gull} plumage patterns.

\subsection{System Architecture}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Feature Extraction Module} (LBP\_generation.py)
%     \item \textbf{Core Analysis Module} (analysis.py)
%     \item \textbf{Specialized Pattern Analyzers} (1s\_analysis.py, Transitions\_analysis.py, Analysis\_main.py)
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{LBP Feature Extraction}

The feature extraction process implements a rotation-invariant uniform LBP operator with optimized parameters:

\begin{equation}
LBP_{P,R}^{riu2} = \begin{cases}
\sum_{p=0}^{P-1} s(g_p - g_c) & \text{if } U(LBP_{P,R}) \leq 2 \\
P+1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $U(LBP_{P,R})$ counts the number of bitwise transitions, $g_c$ is the central pixel, and $g_p$ are neighboring pixels.

\subsubsection{Implementation Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Circular neighborhood with radius $R=3$ pixels
    \item $P=24$ sampling points ($8\times R$)
    \item Dual-mode operation: Both default and uniform patterns
    \item Normalized intensity values (0-255 range)
    \item Mask-aware processing (only segmented regions)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Abstract Feature Derivation}

For each LBP pattern, we compute two rotation-invariant abstract features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bit Count} ($B$): Number of '1' bits in the pattern
    \begin{equation}
    B = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} s(g_i - g_c)
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Transition Count} ($T$): Circular bit transitions
    \begin{equation}
    T = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} |s(g_i - g_c) - s(g_{i+1 \mod P} - g_c)|
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

These features are aggregated into normalized histograms with $P+1$ bins each.

\subsection{Texture Analysis Framework}

The analysis module (analysis.py) implements a multi-layered comparative approach:

\subsubsection{Statistical Texture Features}

For each histogram $H$, we compute five key descriptors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entropy}: $-\sum H \log_2(H + \epsilon)$
    \item \textbf{Energy}: $\sum H^2$
    \item \textbf{Contrast}: $\sum i^2 H(i) - (\sum i H(i))^2$
    \item \textbf{Homogeneity}: $\sum \frac{H(i)}{1+|i-\mu|}$
    \item \textbf{Uniformity}: Equivalent to Energy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparative Metrics}

Between species histograms $H_1$ and $H_2$, we compute:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric KL Divergence:
    \begin{equation}
    D_{KL}^{sym} = \frac{1}{2}[D_{KL}(H_1||H_2) + D_{KL}(H_2||H_1)]
    \end{equation}
    
    \item Jensen-Shannon Distance:
    \begin{equation}
    D_{JS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(H_1||M) + \frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(H_2||M)}, \quad M=\frac{H_1+H_2}{2}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item Earth Mover's Distance
    \item Chi-Square Distance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction}

The implementation includes three complementary visualization strategies:

\subsubsection{Histogram Comparison}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Side-by-side histogram plots with difference metrics
    \item Region-specific comparisons (wing, wingtip, head)
    \item Dual-species overlay with significance indicators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Principal Component Analysis}

\begin{equation}
X_{pca} = (X - \mu)\Sigma^{-1}V^T
\end{equation}

where $V$ contains the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. We visualize:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 2D PCA projections with variance explained
    \item Species separation metrics
    \item Abstract feature subspaces
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Heatmaps of percentage differences

\section{Local Binary Pattern Gemini}

Local Binary Patterns (LBP) constitute a robust and computationally efficient texture analysis technique, originally proposed by Ojala et al. \Citep{1017623}. LBP characterizes local image texture by comparing each pixel's intensity with its surrounding neighbors, generating a binary code that summarizes the local structure. This descriptor is particularly advantageous for biological image analysis due to several key properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Robustness to monotonic grayscale variations, enhancing resilience to changing illumination conditions.
    \item Computational efficiency coupled with high discriminative power for texture classification.
    \item Potential for rotation invariance, especially when using specific LBP variants or derived features.
    \item Ability to capture fine-scale micro-patterns potentially imperceptible to human vision.
\end{itemize}

These characteristics make LBP well-suited for differentiating seagull species based on subtle plumage texture differences, which may remain consistent across variations in lighting and viewpoint.

\subsection{Implementation Methodology}

The methodology involved extracting LBP features from specific anatomical regions of seagull images, followed by statistical analysis to identify discriminative texture properties between species.

\subsubsection{Image Preprocessing and Region Extraction}

For each image pair (original and segmentation mask):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The original image was loaded using OpenCV.
    \item The image was converted to grayscale.
    \item Min-max normalization was applied to the entire grayscale image to scale intensity values to the range [0, 255].
    \item Pre-defined anatomical regions (wing, wingtip, head) were extracted using corresponding segmentation masks. The mask identified pixels belonging to the specific region of interest. Pixels outside the mask were excluded from subsequent LBP calculations for that region.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{LBP Feature Calculation}

The core LBP feature extraction was performed on the normalized grayscale values within each segmented region using the `skimage.feature.local_binary_pattern` function. Key parameters were configured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Radius (R)}: Set to 3 pixels, defining the radial distance of the neighbors from the center pixel.
    \item \textbf{Number of Points (P)}: Set to $8 \times R = 24$ points, determining the number of neighbors sampled on the circle around the center pixel.
    \item \textbf{Method}: The 'uniform' LBP variant was employed. Uniform LBP patterns have at most two bitwise 0/1 or 1/0 transitions. This variant reduces the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining significant texture information and providing rotation invariance. (Note: While 'uniform' was the primary method implemented in the generation script, analysis scripts suggest 'default' LBP results may also have been generated and analyzed).
\end{itemize}

The LBP operator generated an LBP code for each pixel within the masked region by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Examining a circular neighborhood (Radius R, P points) around the pixel.
    \item Comparing the intensity of each neighbor point to the center pixel's intensity.
    \item Assigning '1' if the neighbor's intensity was greater than or equal to the center, '0' otherwise.
    \item Forming a P-bit binary number from these comparisons.
    \item Converting this binary number to its decimal equivalent (the LBP code).
\end{enumerate}
The LBP codes for all pixels within a specific region were collected. A normalized histogram of these LBP codes (256 bins for the range [0, 255]) was then computed for each region of each image, using `density=True` to account for varying region sizes.

\subsubsection{Abstract Pattern Feature Extraction}

To capture rotation-invariant characteristics independent of the specific LBP code values, abstract features were derived from the binary representation of each LBP code before histogramming:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Binary Pattern Generation}: Each LBP decimal value (within the masked region) was converted to its $P=24$-bit binary string representation.
    \item \textbf{Ones Count}: For each binary pattern, the number of '1' bits was counted. This represents the frequency of neighboring pixels brighter than or equal to the central pixel. A histogram of these counts (bins from 0 to $P+1$) was computed (`density=True`). Higher mean counts suggest textures with more bright spots or edges relative to the center pixel.
    \item \textbf{Transitions Count}: For each circular binary pattern, the number of transitions (0-to-1 or 1-to-0) was counted. This captures the local angular frequency or complexity of the texture pattern. A histogram of transition counts (bins from 0 to $P+1$) was computed (`density=True`). Higher mean transitions suggest more complex textures with frequent local changes in brightness.
\end{enumerate}
These abstract feature histograms (Ones Histogram, Transitions Histogram) were generated alongside the standard LBP histogram for each region of each image.

\subsubsection{Statistical Texture Feature Calculation}

From the *average* LBP, Ones, and Transitions histograms computed per species and per region, several statistical texture features were calculated using the `calculate_texture_features` function to summarize the overall texture characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Entropy}: Shannon entropy, quantifying the randomness or complexity of the histogram distribution. $E = -\sum_{i} p(i) \log_2(p(i) + \epsilon)$, where $p(i)$ is the normalized histogram frequency for bin $i$.
    \item \textbf{Energy/Uniformity}: Sum of squared histogram elements, measuring the uniformity of the distribution. $U = \sum_{i} p(i)^2$. Higher values indicate less complex, more uniform textures.
    \item \textbf{Contrast}: A measure of the local intensity variations, calculated as the weighted variance of the histogram indices. $C = \sum_{i} (i - \mu)^2 p(i)$, where $\mu$ is the mean histogram index.
    \item \textbf{Homogeneity}: Measures the closeness of the distribution of elements to the histogram diagonal (in GLCM context, adapted here). $H = \sum_{i} \frac{p(i)}{1 + |i - \mu|}$. Higher values indicate smoother textures.
\end{enumerate}
Additionally, basic intensity statistics (mean and standard deviation) within each masked region were calculated.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis Implementation}

To quantify the differences in texture distributions between the two seagull species for each region, several histogram comparison metrics were calculated using the `calculate_metrics` function:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Symmetric KL Divergence}: Measures the relative entropy between the two average histograms (Slaty-backed vs. Glaucous-winged) for a given region and feature type (LBP, Ones, Transitions). $D_{KL,sym}(P||Q) = \frac{D_{KL}(P||Q) + D_{KL}(Q||P)}{2}$.
    \item \textbf{Earth Mover's Distance (Wasserstein Distance)}: Measures the minimum "work" required to transform one histogram into the other, considering the distance between bins. Calculated using `scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance`.
    \item \textbf{Chi-Square Distance}: Measures the difference between the histograms. $\chi^2 = \sum_{i} \frac{(p_1(i) - p_2(i))^2}{p_1(i) + p_2(i) + \epsilon}$.
    \item \textbf{Jensen-Shannon Distance}: A symmetric and smoothed version of KL divergence, providing a bounded metric between 0 and 1. Calculated using `scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon`.
\end{enumerate}
These metrics were applied to the average LBP, Ones, and Transitions histograms for each anatomical region.

\subsection{Discriminative Power Analysis}

The discriminative power of each texture feature (statistical features, mean ones count, mean transitions count) for distinguishing between species within each anatomical region was assessed.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each region and feature combination, the average feature value was calculated for each species.
    \item The absolute percentage difference between the species' average values was computed: $Diff\% = \frac{|Value_{Slaty} - Value_{Glaucous}|}{\max(Value_{Slaty}, Value_{Glaucous})} \times 100$.
    \item Region-feature pairs were ranked based on this percentage difference to identify the most discriminative characteristics.
    \item Results were visualized using heatmaps and bar charts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to visualize the high-dimensional LBP, Ones, and Transitions histogram data in a 2D space for each region.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Histogram data for a specific feature type and region was collected across all images.
    \item The data was standardized (zero mean, unit variance) using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`.
    \item PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality to two principal components using `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`.
    \item Scatter plots were generated, plotting the first principal component (PC1) against the second (PC2), with points colored by species.
    \item The percentage of variance explained by each principal component was calculated and displayed to assess information retention.
\end{enumerate}
These plots provide a visual assessment of the separability between the species based on the selected texture features.

\subsection{Implementation Workflow}

The analysis pipeline was implemented in Python using libraries such as OpenCV, Scikit-image, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy. It consisted of distinct modules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction Module}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loaded original and segmentation images based on configuration.
        \item Performed preprocessing (grayscale conversion, normalization).
        \item Extracted anatomical regions using masks.
        \item Computed LBP codes ('uniform' method, R=3, P=24).
        \item Calculated normalized histograms for LBP codes, Ones counts, and Transitions counts.
        \item Calculated mean and standard deviation of intensity per region.
        \item Saved all extracted features (histograms and basic stats) to a CSV file (`lbp_abstract_features.csv`).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Analysis Modules}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loaded the features from the CSV file(s).
        \item Calculated average histograms per species/region.
        \item Calculated advanced statistical texture features (Entropy, Energy, Contrast, Homogeneity) from average LBP histograms.
        \item Calculated mean values for Ones and Transitions counts per species/region.
        \item Performed comparative analysis using histogram distance metrics (KL, EMD, Chi-Square, JS).
        \item Assessed discriminative power using percentage differences.
        \item Performed PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
        \item Generated various visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) and summary reports/CSVs saved to dedicated output directories.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
This modular structure facilitated systematic processing and analysis.

\subsection{Validation Aspects}

Several aspects of the implementation contribute to the reliability of the analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Grayscale normalization was applied to mitigate global illumination effects. Histograms were density-normalized to account for variations in the size of segmented regions. Feature data was standardized before PCA.
    \item \textbf{Region-Specific Analysis}: Analysis was performed independently for different anatomical regions, allowing for localized texture differences to be identified.
    \item \textbf{Multiple Metrics}: Several distinct histogram comparison metrics were used to provide a more robust assessment of distribution differences.
    \item \textbf{Quantitative Evaluation}: Discriminative power was quantified using percentage differences, providing an objective ranking of feature importance.
    \item \textbf{Abstract Features}: The use of Ones and Transitions counts provides features that are inherently more robust to rotation compared to raw LBP codes.
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive methodology provides a framework for extracting, analyzing, and comparing texture features based on LBP and its derived abstract patterns to differentiate between the two seagull species.
