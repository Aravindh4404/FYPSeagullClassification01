\section{Local Binary Pattern Gemini}

Local Binary Patterns (LBP) constitute a robust and computationally efficient texture analysis technique, originally proposed by Ojala et al. \Citep{1017623}. LBP characterizes local image texture by comparing each pixel's intensity with its surrounding neighbors, generating a binary code that summarizes the local structure. This descriptor is particularly advantageous for biological image analysis due to several key properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Robustness to monotonic grayscale variations, enhancing resilience to changing illumination conditions.
    \item Rotation invariance when using specific LBP variants or derived features (1s and transition histograms)
    \item Ability to capture fine-scale micro-patterns potentially imperceptible to human vision.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Local Binary Pattern Analysis}

The texture analysis methodology employs Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to quantify the textural characteristics of gull feather regions. LBP is a powerful texture descriptor that captures local spatial structure by comparing each pixel with its neighboring pixels.

\subsubsection{LBP Computation}

For a given pixel at position $(x_c, y_c)$ with intensity $g_c$, the LBP value is computed by comparing it with $P$ neighbors at radius $R$ using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\text{LBP}_{P,R}(x_c, y_c) = \sum_{p=0}^{P-1} s(g_p - g_c) \cdot 2^p
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $g_p$ is the intensity of the neighbor pixel $p$
    \item $s(x)$ is the step function defined as:
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
s(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
0, & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

We implemented uniform LBP patterns, which account for transitions between 0s and 1s in the binary representation, thereby capturing fundamental texture elements like edges and corners while reducing dimensionality.

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction}

From the LBP computation, three primary feature histograms were extracted:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{LBP Histogram}: Distribution of LBP codes across the region of interest
    
    \item \textbf{Ones Histogram}: Distribution of the number of 1s in each LBP code, calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
    H_{\text{ones}}(i) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} [b(j) = i]
    \end{equation}
    where $b(j)$ represents the number of 1s in pattern $j$, and $[\cdot]$ is the Iverson bracket
    
    \item \textbf{Transitions Histogram}: Distribution of 0-to-1 or 1-to-0 transitions in each LBP code:
    \begin{equation}
    H_{\text{trans}}(i) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} [t(j) = i]
    \end{equation}
    where $t(j)$ counts the transitions in pattern $j$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Texture Feature Quantification}

From these histograms, several texture properties were calculated to characterize the regions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Entropy}: Measures randomness in texture patterns
    \begin{equation}
    E = -\sum_{i} h(i) \log_2 h(i)
    \end{equation}
    where $h(i)$ is the normalized histogram value at bin $i$
    
    \item \textbf{Energy}: Measures uniformity of texture
    \begin{equation}
    U = \sum_{i} h(i)^2
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Contrast}: Measures intensity variations
    \begin{equation}
    C = \sum_{i} (i - \mu)^2 h(i)
    \end{equation}
    where $\mu$ is the mean value of the histogram
    
    \item \textbf{Homogeneity}: Measures closeness of distribution
    \begin{equation}
    H = \sum_{i} \frac{h(i)}{1 + |i - \mu|}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distribution Comparison Metrics}

To quantify differences between species, we employed the following statistical measures:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Jensen-Shannon Distance}: Measure of similarity between probability distributions
    \begin{equation}
    JSD(P||Q) = \sqrt{\frac{D_{KL}(P||M) + D_{KL}(Q||M)}{2}}
    \end{equation}
    where $M = \frac{P+Q}{2}$ and $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence
    
    \item \textbf{Earth Mover's Distance}: Measures the minimum "work" required to transform one distribution into another
    \begin{equation}
    EMD(P, Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma(P, Q)} \int d(x, y) d\gamma(x, y)
    \end{equation}
    where $\Gamma(P, Q)$ is the set of all distributions with marginals $P$ and $Q$
    
    \item \textbf{Chi-Square Distance}: Measures the goodness of fit between distributions
    \begin{equation}
    \chi^2(P, Q) = \sum_{i} \frac{(P_i - Q_i)^2}{P_i + Q_i}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to visualize the high-dimensional LBP feature space in two dimensions:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X_{PCA}} = \mathbf{X} \cdot \mathbf{W}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{W}$ is the matrix of eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}$ corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues, and $\mathbf{X}$ is the standardized feature matrix.

This methodology allowed us to comprehensively analyze the textural differences between Slaty-backed and Glaucous-winged Gull feather patterns, providing both quantitative metrics and visual representations of the distinguishing characteristics.

The feature extraction process implements a rotation-invariant uniform LBP operator with optimized parameters:

\begin{equation}
LBP_{P,R}^{riu2} = \begin{cases}
\sum_{p=0}^{P-1} s(g_p - g_c) & \text{if } U(LBP_{P,R}) \leq 2 \\
P+1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $U(LBP_{P,R})$ counts the number of bitwise transitions, $g_c$ is the central pixel, and $g_p$ are neighboring pixels.

\subsubsection{Implementation Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Circular neighborhood with radius $R=3$ pixels
    \item $P=24$ sampling points ($8\times R$)
    \item Dual-mode operation: Both default and uniform patterns
    \item Normalized intensity values (0-255 range)
    \item Mask-aware processing (only segmented regions)
\end{itemize}

The LBP operator generated an LBP code for each pixel within the masked region
by:
1. Examining a circular neighborhood (Radius R, P points) around the pixel.
2. Comparing the intensity of each neighbor point to the center pixel’s intensity.
3. Assigning ’1’ if the neighbor’s intensity was greater than or equal to the
center, ’0’ otherwise.
4. Forming a P-bit binary number from these comparisons.
5. Converting this binary number to its decimal equivalent (the LBP code).


\subsubsection{Abstract Feature Derivation}

For each LBP pattern, we compute two rotation-invariant abstract features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bit Count} ($B$): Number of '1' bits in the pattern
    \begin{equation}
    B = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} s(g_i - g_c)
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Transition Count} ($T$): Circular bit transitions
    \begin{equation}
    T = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} |s(g_i - g_c) - s(g_{i+1 \mod P} - g_c)|
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

These features are aggregated into normalized histograms with $P+1$ bins each.
