====== ANALYSIS REPORT: wingtip ======
Analysis Date: 2025-03-02 12:20:21

Number of features analyzed: 24
Number of statistically significant features (p < 0.05): 0

----- SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES -----
No statistically significant differences were found between species.

----- ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS -----
• Check for potential artifacts such as differences in wing angle, lighting, or image quality.
• Verify that the sample sizes are adequate and representative of the overall population.
• Consider rotation-invariant or scale-invariant texture features (e.g., LBP or SIFT-like methods)
  if wing orientation or size variation is large.

----- CONCLUSION -----
No significant differences were found with the current Gabor filter parameters. Consider adjusting parameters (e.g., more orientations/frequencies) or exploring other feature extraction methods.
