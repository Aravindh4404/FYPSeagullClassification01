# Wing and Wingtip Analysis: Slaty-backed Gull vs Glaucous-winged Gull

## Key Findings

### 1. Wing Intensity
- **Slaty-backed Gull**: 76.45 ± 22.36
- **Glaucous-winged Gull**: 153.32 ± 31.49
- **Difference**: Glaucous-winged wings are 100.6% brighter
- **Statistical Significance**: Highly significant difference (p < 0.001)

### 2. Wingtip Darkness
- **Slaty-backed Gull**: 56.62% of wingtip pixels darker than wing
- **Glaucous-winged Gull**: 47.73% of wingtip pixels darker than wing

### 3. Very Dark Pixels
- **Slaty-backed Gull**:
  - 20.86% pixels < 30 intensity
  - 30.13% pixels < 40 intensity
  - 38.38% pixels < 50 intensity

- **Glaucous-winged Gull**:
  - 0.0340% pixels < 30 intensity
  - 0.1459% pixels < 40 intensity
  - 0.3737% pixels < 50 intensity

### 4. Raw Pixel Counts
- **Slaty-backed Gull**: Average of 61450 very dark pixels
- **Glaucous-winged Gull**: Average of 3 very dark pixels

## Biological Significance

These results demonstrate clear, quantifiable differences between the two gull species:

1. **Overall Wing Color**: Slaty-backed Gulls have significantly darker wings, with intensity values approximately half those of Glaucous-winged Gulls.

2. **Wingtip Darkness Pattern**: Slaty-backed Gulls have a dramatically higher percentage of very dark pixels in their wingtips. Over 20% of wingtip pixels have intensity below 30, compared to virtually none in Glaucous-winged Gulls.

3. **Species Identification Feature**: The presence of very dark pixels (intensity < 30) in the wingtip appears to be a reliable diagnostic feature for distinguishing between these species.

4. **Contrast Pattern**: The higher percentage of dark pixels in Slaty-backed Gull wingtips creates a more pronounced visual contrast between wing and wingtip regions.

These quantitative differences align with field observations that Slaty-backed Gulls have darker wings and more prominent dark wingtips compared to Glaucous-winged Gulls, providing a reliable basis for species identification in image analysis.
