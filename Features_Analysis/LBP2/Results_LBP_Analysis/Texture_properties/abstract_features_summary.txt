INTERPRETATION GUIDE
-------------------
Number of Ones: Measures how many neighboring pixels are brighter than center
  - Higher values: More bright spots or edges within darker regions
  - Lower values: More uniform dark or bright regions

Transitions: Counts how many times the binary pattern switches between 0 and 1
  - Higher values: More complex textures with frequent brightness changes
  - Lower values: Smoother textures with fewer brightness changes

SIGNIFICANCE FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION
--------------------------------------

The most discriminative abstract feature is Number of Ones in the head region with a difference of 10.40%.
2. Transitions in wing: 9.43% difference
3. Number of Ones in wingtip: 9.38% difference
4. Transitions in wingtip: 8.03% difference
5. Number of Ones in wing: 6.93% difference

CONCLUSION
----------
Abstract pattern analysis reveals Number of Ones in the head as the most distinctive texture feature between the two gull species.

The Number of Ones feature captures the brightness relationship pattern between neighboring pixels.
This suggests that the two gull species differ significantly in how brightness is distributed in their feathers,
which may reflect differences in their feather structure and coloration patterns.

Both abstract pattern features provide robust metrics for identification that can complement
traditional intensity-based measurements. These features are particularly useful because they
can remain distinctive even when lighting conditions vary, providing reliable differentiating characteristics.
